## Data Analysis and Visualisation

In this project I have analyzed and visualized the data from the data set https://acehacker.com/microsoft/engage2022/cars_engage_2022.csv  and tried to draw some meaningful insights.

Steps involved:
- Pre processing data in python
- Analyzing the data with the help of python libraries
- Plotting the graphs and visualizing the data

## Softwares and Libraries Used:

    - Anaconda Distribution
	- Jupyter Notebook
    - Django
	
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- Matplotlib
    - Mpld3
	- Seaborn
	
## Importing the Modules:

	  import pandas as pd
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
      import mpld3
